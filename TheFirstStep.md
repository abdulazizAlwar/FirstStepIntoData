<h1>0. What is this?</h1>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>This page is meant to help anybody interested in Data Science, AI, Machine Learning and even just Python programming to get started with coding right away!</p>
<p>We all know how hard it is to learn something new, especially something technical. There are so many, resources, courses, things to install and configure that you lose motivation before you even begin. This will help take the first step with the simplest resources to use! So you can actually start doing the fun stuff :)</p>

    </strong>
  </u>
</p>
<p>Just go to the above link!</p>
<p>Kaggle is one of the best if not the best resource for Data Science! You can find courses, notebooks (interactive files you can code and visualize in), datasets and even competitions when you're confident enough.</p>
<p>The courses are all free and all the coding is done in the browser, so you don't need to install anything at all. Everything will be done inside the course, starting from your first line of Python, into Data Science basics like dataframes and visualization. You can do everything there.</p>

<h1>2. Getting Started</h1>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>About the courses, here is what I recommend for each skill level:</p>
<h3>Zero Coding Experience</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming">https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming</a>
</p>
<p>The best intro to programming and it's all interactive!</p>
<h3>I Did Some Coding But Forgot it All...</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python">https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python</a>
</p>
<p>This course will give you all the Python fundamentals you need for Data Science</p>
<h3>I Know Python</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas">https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas</a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization">https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization</a>
</p>
<strong><p>Once you are familiar with Python, here is where all the fun stuff will happen!</p></strong>
<p>Start with pandas to work with dataframes (data table format), then Data Visualization. With these two skills, you can do so many cool things with data and Python.</p>
<p>

<h1>3. I Know the Basics Now</h1>
<p>
  <br/>
</p>
<p>Before you start with Machine Learning, first you need to practice! Go through the following notebooks and exercises, you can even use different datasets or your own datasets and see what kind of insight you can get.</p>
<h3>Pandas &amp; Visualization Code Samples</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/pandas-intro">https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/pandas-intro</a> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/pandas-filtering">https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/pandas-filtering</a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/pandas-groupby-sorting-more-manipulation">https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/pandas-groupby-sorting-more-manipulation</a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/visualization-with-seaborn">https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/visualization-with-seaborn</a>
</p>
<p>The above notebooks contain most of the fundamental techniques you use in pandas and seaborn. You can copy from them anytime you forget how to do a certain thing with pandas or seaborn.</p>
<h3>Pandas &amp; Visualization</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/excercise-mcdonalds-calories">https://www.kaggle.com/code/abdulaziz7/excercise-mcdonalds-calories</a>
</p>
<p>A simple exercise to practice visualization on a simple dataset of McDonald's menu items and their calories.</p>
<h3>Other Interesting Datasets to Play With</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?select=titles.csv</a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn</a>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/petrolgas-prices-worldwide">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/petrolgas-prices-worldwide</a>
</p>
<p>Analyze these datasets with pandas and Seaborn, and see what kind of interesting insight you can find! The more datasets you work with, the more your analytical skills will grow, and the more fun you will have working on data.</p>

<h1>4. Learning Machine Learning</h1>
<p>Now that you are comfortable with working with data, we can start diving into the world of Machine Learning. You can find hundreds of resources online for Machine Learning focusing on Math, Statistics, Deep Learning, etc. While those are important concepts, You do not need to focus on them when you're just starting. Instead, I recommend focusing on doing the fundamental tasks with code. Once you are comfortable enough with that, then you can dive even deeper into more complex Machine Learning concepts. </p>
<h3>Start Here</h3>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning">https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning</a>
</p>
<p>An introduction to the fundamental components of a ML project. </p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Machine Learning Workflow Templates</h3>

  </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span style="letter-spacing: 0.0px;">The above notebooks contain most of the fundamental techniques you use in a simple ML prototype for Classification or Regression. Feel free to use them as a template to run Machine Learning on your own datasets.</span>
